# Python - Laboratory MQTT

This project is associated to the MQTT Laboratory in order to design and create a simple MQTT application emulating 
an IoT scenario where multiple electric vehicles periodically publish telemetry information related to GPS location, 
speed and battery level. Furthermore, each vehicle at the startup publish a description (retained) message containing
information associated to its unique identification, manufacturer and model. An external consumer subscribe to receive
both telemetry and description messages from all the available vehicles.
